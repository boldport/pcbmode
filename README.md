## PCBmodE
PCBmodE is a printed circuit board design Python script that creates an SVG from [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) input files, and then creates [Gerber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerber_format) and Excellon files for manufacturing. 

PCBmodE gives the designer the freedome to place any arbitrary shape on any layer, as it is natively vector-based. Much of the design is done in a text editor -- editing JSON -- with viewing and some editing -- routing mostly -- done with [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org).

### Requirements

You'll need:
* Python 2.7
* [PyParsing](http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/)
* [lxml](http://lxml.de/index.html)
* [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org)

PCBmodE is developed and tested under Linux, so it might or might not work under other OSs. (It'd be helpful to know success or failure of attempts!)

### The name
The 'mod' in PCBmodE has a double meaning. The first is short for 'modern' (in contrast to tired old EDA tools). The second is a play on the familiar 'modifications' or 'mods' done to imperfect PCBs. Call it 'PCB mode' or 'PCB mod E', whichever you prefer.
